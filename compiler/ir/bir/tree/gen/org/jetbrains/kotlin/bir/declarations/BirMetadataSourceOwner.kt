/**
 * An [BirElement] capable of holding something which backends can use to write
 * as the metadata for the declaration.
 *
 * Technically, it can even be Â± an array of bytes, but right now it's usually the frontend representation of the declaration,
 * so a descriptor in case of K1, and [org.jetbrains.kotlin.fir.FirElement] in case of K2,
 * and the backend invokes a metadata serializer on it to obtain metadata and write it, for example, to `@kotlin.Metadata`
 * on JVM.
